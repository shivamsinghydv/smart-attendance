      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
      The Smart Attendance System is a microcontroller-based solution developed to modernize the traditional methods of student attendance tracking. Leveraging the ESP32 microcontroller and the RC522 RFID reader, this system allows for quick and contactless attendance marking, simply by tapping an RFID card. Each student is assigned a unique RFID tag that is registered in the system. When the tag is tapped near the RC522 sensor, the ESP32 reads the data and logs the student's presence, along with the exact timestamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each RFID tag is uniquely associated with a student and, when scanned, is recorded along with the timestamp. The data can be sent over Wi-Fi to a server or logged locally, depending on the setup. This reduces manual errors, saves valuable class time, and eliminates the need for traditional paper-based registers.One of the main goals behind this project was to reduce classroom time spent on roll calls while also minimizing human error in recordkeeping. Teachers no longer need to manually mark attendance, and students avoid waiting in long queues or being part of a slow verbal process. The system can be connected to Wi-Fi to log attendance data to a cloud database or server, enabling real-time tracking and remote access for administrators.
      </p>
      <p>
        This solution is cost-effective, making it ideal for schools, colleges, and training centers operating under tight budgets. Its scalability ensures it can be implemented in classrooms of any size, and its plug-and-play simplicity means it can be deployed with minimal technical expertise. Itâ€™s a step forward toward digitizing education infrastructure and embracing smart automation in daily academic routines.
